<!-- ### About Me -->

I am a Flatiron Research Fellow in the [NeuroAI and Geometric Data Analysis Lab](https://www.sychunglab.org/) led by [SueYeon Chung](https://sites.google.com/site/sueyeonchung) at [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/)'s [Center for Computational Neuroscience](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-neuroscience/). I received my PhD in Physics in 2022 from [Harvard University](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/), where I worked on deep learning theory under the supervision of [Cengiz Pehlevan](https://pehlevan.seas.harvard.edu/people/cengiz-pehlevan).
Before that, I earned my M.Sc. in Physics and B.Sc. in Electronics Engineering from [Sabancı University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/en).

### Current Research

My research lies at the intersection of neuroscience, machine learning, and physics, with a focus on understanding how the brain processes and represents natural stimuli. I develop theoretical frameworks and computational models to study neural representations of sensory inputs. I apply tools from statistical mechanics, random matrix theory, and deep learning to uncover the principles underlying neural computation and perception.

I am particularly interested in:

-   Neural representation of natural stimuli and their geometric structure
-   Information processing in biological and artificial neural networks
-   Development of robust tools for describing representational geometry
-   Statistical physics of learning and neural computation
