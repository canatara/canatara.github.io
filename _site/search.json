    "text": "I am a Flatiron Research Fellow in the NeuroAI and Geometric Data Analysis Lab led by SueYeon Chung at Flatiron Institute’s Center for Computational Neuroscience. I received my PhD in Physics in 2022 from Harvard University, where I worked on deep learning theory under the supervision of Cengiz Pehlevan. Before that, I earned my M.Sc. in Physics and B.Sc. in Electronics Engineering from Sabancı University.\n\nCurrent Research\nMy research lies at the intersection of neuroscience, machine learning, and physics, with a focus on understanding how the brain processes and represents natural stimuli. I develop theoretical frameworks and computational models to study neural representations of sensory inputs. I apply tools from statistical mechanics, random matrix theory, and deep learning to uncover the principles underlying neural computation and perception.\nI am particularly interested in:\n\nNeural representation of natural stimuli and their geometric structure\nInformation processing in biological and artificial neural networks\nDevelopment of robust tools for describing representational geometry\nStatistical physics of learning and neural computation\n\n\n\nSelected Publications\nSpectral Analysis of Representational Similarity with Limited Neurons\nHyunmo Kang*, Abdulkadir Canatar*, and SueYeon Chung\nAdvances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2025 Link\nEstimating Neural Representation Alignment from Sparsely Sampled Inputs and Features\nChanwoo Chun*, Abdulkadir Canatar*, SueYeon Chung, and Daniel Lee\n8th Annual Conference on Cognitive Computational Neuroscience, 2025 Link\nStatistical mechanics of support vector regression\nAbdulkadir Canatar and SueYeon Chung\nPhysical Review E, 2025 Link\nA Spectral Theory of Neural Prediction and Alignment\nAbdulkadir Canatar*, Jenelle Feather*, Albert Wakhloo, and SueYeon Chung\nAdvances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 36, 2024 Link\nOut-of-distribution generalization in kernel regression\nAbdulkadir Canatar, Blake Bordelon, and Cengiz Pehlevan\nAdvances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2021 Link\nSpectral bias and task-model alignment explain generalization in kernel regression and infinitely wide neural networks\nAbdulkadir Canatar, Blake Bordelon, and Cengiz Pehlevan\nNature Communications, 2021 Link\n\n\nContact\nOffice: 160 Fifth Ave, New York, NY 10010\nEmail: acanatar@flatironinstitute.org"
